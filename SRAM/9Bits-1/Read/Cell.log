Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `Energy', during task `MDLControl'.
    There are 8 IC nodes defined.
Notice from spectre during IC analysis, during transient analysis `Energy', during task `MDLControl'.
    GminDC = 1 pS is large enough to noticeably affect the DC solution.
        dV(X14.1) = 23.2736 mV
        Use the `gmin_check' option to eliminate or expand this report.
    Initial condition computed for node BL3 is in error by 255.061 uV.
        Decrease `rforce' to reduce error in computed initial conditions.  However, setting rforce too small may result in convergence difficulties or in the matrix becoming singular.

DC simulation time: CPU = 5.153 ms, elapsed = 5.21708 ms.

Notice from spectre during transient analysis `Energy', during task `MDLControl'.
    No outputs were found. Loosening output filter criterion to `allpub'.

Maximum value achieved for any signal of each quantity: 
V: V(X1.Q) = 1.078 V
I: I(Vpre1:p) = 3.823 mA
If your circuit contains signals of the same quantity that are vastly different in size (such as high voltage circuitry combined with low voltage control circuitry), you should consider specifying global option `bin_relref=yes'.
